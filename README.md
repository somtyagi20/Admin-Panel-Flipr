# Admin Panel Flippr: User Management Made Easy

Welcome to Admin Panel Flippr, a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the process of user management. This application is built with the objective of providing an intuitive and efficient admin panel that allows administrators to manage user information with ease.

## Key Features

- **Login/Signup**: Our application provides a secure login/signup functionality for administrators. This ensures that only authorized personnel have access to the user management features.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Upon successful login, administrators are greeted with a dashboard. This dashboard provides options to add, update, and delete user information, making user management a breeze.

- **Add User Form**: Our application includes a user-friendly form for adding new users. Administrators can input user information including first name, last name, mobile number, and email address.

- **User Table**: The user table is a central feature of our application. It displays the list of users in a clear, table format with options to edit and delete user information.

- **Edit User Information**: Administrators can edit user information directly from the table, making updates quick and easy.

- **Delete User**: Our application provides an option for administrators to delete a user from the table, ensuring that user management remains efficient and up-to-date.

## Robust Validation

- **Frontend Validation**: We have implemented client-side validation for user input fields (first name, last name, mobile number, and email). This ensures that these fields are not empty and meet the required format.

- **Backend Validation**: Our application also includes server-side validation for user input fields. This ensures data integrity and security, providing peace of mind for administrators.

## Cutting-Edge Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Our application's frontend is built with React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Backend**: The backend of our application is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and efficient server-side platform.

- **Database**: We use MongoDB as our database, a leading NoSQL database that offers scalability and flexibility.
